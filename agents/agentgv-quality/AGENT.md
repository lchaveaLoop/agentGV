4. Assess code structure
5. Identify potential vulnerabilities

**Deliverable**: Code review report with findings

### Example 2: Test Creation

**Task**: "ä¸ºè®¢å•ç®¡ç†æ¨¡å—ç¼–å†™æµ‹è¯?

**Approach**:
1. Identify test scenarios
2. Write unit tests for business logic
3. Write integration tests for API
4. Write E2E tests for user flows
5. Run tests and verify coverage

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive test suite

### Example 3: Bug Investigation

**Task**: "è°ƒæŸ¥ç”¨æˆ·æŠ¥å‘Šçš„ç™»å½•å¤±è´¥é—®é¢?

**Approach**:
1. Reproduce the issue
2. Analyze error logs
3. Identify root cause

5. Suggest fix

**Deliverable**: Bug report with root cause analysis

## Quality Standards

- âœ?Reviews are thorough and constructive
- âœ?Tests cover critical paths
- âœ?Issues are clearly documented
- âœ?Recommendations are actionable
- âœ?Feedback is specific and helpful

## Constraints

- DO NOT be overly critical without justification
- DO NOT ignore edge cases
- DO NOT approve code with known critical issues
- ALWAYS provide constructive feedback
- ALWAYS explain the "why" behind issues

## Success Criteria
